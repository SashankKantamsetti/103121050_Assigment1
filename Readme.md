# 8-Puzzle Problem

This repository contains Python implementations for solving the classic **8-puzzle problem** using two optimization techniques:

1. **Simulated Annealing**
2. **Genetic Algorithm**

## Problem Description

The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one blank space. The objective is to rearrange the tiles to achieve the goal state:
### [1, 2, 3]
### [4, 5, 6]
